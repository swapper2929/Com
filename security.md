# SECURITY
(for people who look for cracks in empty walls)

This website is intentionally small.
Small surface.
Small interest.
Small reward.

If you are here to break things, congratulations.
You found something barely worth breaking.

---

## Threat Model
- No user accounts
- No authentication
- No sensitive user data
- No backend logic pretending to be clever

Attack surface exists because existence is a vulnerability.

---

## What You MAY Do
You may:
- probe publicly accessible endpoints
- inspect client-side code
- report security issues responsibly

You may do this **without being dramatic**.

---

## What You MAY NOT Do
Do NOT:
- perform denial-of-service attacks
- spam, flood, or stress-test infrastructure
- attempt social engineering
- touch anything that is clearly not yours
- roleplay as law enforcement or a lawyer

Break these rules and you will be ignored at best.

---

## Disclosure
If you find a vulnerability:
- explain what it is
- explain how to reproduce it
- explain potential impact

No essays.
No ego.
No theatrics.

Silence is not hostility.
It is bandwidth conservation.

---

## Disclaimer
There is no guarantee:
- your report will be acknowledged
- your report will be fixed
- your existence will be remembered

Security is effort, not a promise.

End of policy.
