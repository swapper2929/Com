# BUG BOUNTY
(expectations management)

Let’s be clear from the start.

This is NOT a corporate program.
This is NOT a contract.
This is NOT a negotiation.

This is a courtesy.

---

## Scope
In scope:
- this website
- its public-facing components
- obvious misconfigurations

Out of scope:
- third-party services
- hosting provider issues
- hypothetical vulnerabilities
- “what if” scenarios
- your imagination

---

## Rewards
There is **NO guaranteed bounty**.

Possible outcomes:
- acknowledgment
- silent fix
- polite indifference
- nothing

If you expect money:
you already misunderstood the situation.

---

## Responsible Reporting
A valid report includes:
- clear description
- reproduction steps
- actual impact

Invalid reports include:
- automated scanner dumps
- fear-based language
- exaggeration
- demands

---

## Legal Reality
By reporting a bug, you acknowledge:
- you are acting in good faith
- you expect no compensation
- you waive drama

If you need paperwork, signatures, or assurance:
close the tab.

---

## Final Note
Finding bugs does not make you important.
Fixing them quietly is the point.

If that bothers you,
you are here for the wrong reasons.

End of bounty.
